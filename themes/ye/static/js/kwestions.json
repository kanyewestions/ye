And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done. And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. The deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet. That is what the deal is about. The deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there\u2019s never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show. The deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater, and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard \u201cWolves,\" when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasn't about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people.

He said you seem, sort of, be open to make very brave decisions. And I think in some points that relates to pushing yourself into new arenas.

He's interested, do these decisions feel brave at the time?", "I really noticed that as we were preparing for this interview. Everyone thinks they know you. I've watched quite a lot of your interviews recently and you've really talked about this idea of not being heard. There's quite an irony to that cause you have such a huge direct reach, but I got the sense you've really felt you were not being listened to or not being understood. Do you think everyone fully understands Kanye West?", "A few people have correlated the president run with your lyrics and particularly the lyric about 'No one man should have all that power.' It\u2019s interesting, you just said you can change your mind, you can be wrong about things.

The question came in quite a lot, but it was posted particularly nicely by Aravin Sandran, he's 25 and from London. And he said, \"do you think the resistance and criticisms to your work is being partly because you're a black man. Would your ideas and work received differently if you were a white man?", "Talking about what you did in the past and what you want to do in the future. A question that was submitted by one of you fans, Sam Hollis.

People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for?", "What specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring?", "Is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity, your sense of self and what you produce?", "It's proven and now we'll continue to prove it. When people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that. They never think about the fact that I've never had the opportunity to be properly educated and if given the meanings to be properly educated or given the proper support groups, I would completely shhh, light the lights up. We sell shoes that people wanna line up for because we put love in them, we put heart in them, we want to make Christmas presents, we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they can't have it. It not a... it's not a... just a financial oppertunity, cause you need finances. But it's a form of discrimination and racism, especially with blacks and fashion. And it literally, you know, it took me, being Kanye West, to get this far in fashion. Meaning, I was being able to become a multimiljonair and invest in myself, because no one else would have. I got this employee, that's a black guy and there will be, sometimes there will be a piece of misinformation. Three weeks later he'll tell me something and he says it kinda, like, with his voice down. I remember being with my dad and my dad was the type of dad that would be everybody's dad. A guy would come in and sell some cookies, but my dad was a sellsman also. So he's saying, \"excuse me, I got these cookies\" and he'd say \"yo, sir, pick your head up and explain to me what you wanna say and what you wanna sell\". This guy, this employee, because blacks especially in America have been raised with slave mentality, don't feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible. And everytime you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible, it's after someone's gotta say \"look at this niggers over there\". So if you don't want to be called a name in a derogatory way. You'd rather put it in what's people's favorite word to use for me?", "Does it frustrate you though?", "It\u2019s such a thing like I had this one stylist come up to me and Virgil was standing next to me and said, \u2018You need to watch out for him. He\u2019s taking your place.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh, the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion?", "We got a question from a guy who talked about gay people within music and within the rap world and stigma towards homosexual rappers. He talked about how you talk a lot about society moving past stigma and being accepting. He said do you feel that\u2019s still a problem within music?", "so here\u2019s a really simple question that I actually don\u2019t know. What would your last meal be?", "Well, I'm answering the second question first. The greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying. Well, I'm sure that I've bullied myself sometimes, but taking away people being able to bully you because you're a creative. We're bullied and controlled by organisations and money and the people with money are in power. And that's gonna change after me and Kim's lifetime. It's gonna go more back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations, but right now it's all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut in creatives in any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way.  Like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart, they take advantage of that. So, me constantly fighting that on the front line I think is the greatest thing I\u2019ve tried to open up, so that creatives can be more empowered, because I believe the world can be saved or helped, and the world meaning us as human beings, our civilisation, us as a race, as one race, can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives, who see more colours than just green. To help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to. What was the first question?", "Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michaelangelo. He asks, how would you define a genius in that context?", "When you made that announcement, was it something you decided on the day or did it just come in the moment that you felt that and you just said it?", "\u2018I\u2019m German and Portuguese and  Asian.\u2019 Just when I gave you that right now. What do you picture in your mind?", "handedness. Is that difficult?", "How did you feel when you heard that your stepfather was going to transition and become a woman?", "they discriminate against celebrity. They discriminate against people with multiple art forms. Or they could say, \u2018Oh wait a second, that cut wasn\u2019t that good,\u2019 but they do enough to throw a stab at, \u2018Oh that didn\u2019t fall the right way\u2019 or \u2018That wasn\u2019t styled the right way.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity, to get overcharged because you\u2019re a musician or people feel like you have money, to get completely taxed by the fashion world. And I love it because it\u2019s like going to Harvard. That\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m in fashion. I think it\u2019s the ultimate training because I dropped out of art school. Eventually, I got a PHD this year, like a honorary PHD at the Art Institute of Chicago. I dropped out of that school and I wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks. Right now, in all honesty... You know whatever the fuck I\u2019m going to say today, I\u2019m going to say it and I\u2019m just gonna fucking own it and that\u2019s how I feel right now. If I feel differently in three years, I\u2019ll tell you how I feel... but right now, the highest art form is actually fashion. What\u2019s funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers. It\u2019s like a class... I mean, where\u2019s architecture?", "So a lot of the people you talk about who you really admire or who you think are talented, do you often see yourself in the work that they\u2019re making?", "A lot of people really relate to specific words. Carl Swaygan said he listened a lot to particular aspects of your music and he talks about suffering from anxiety and PTSD and he said your music has got him through a lot. He asked what gets you through similar things because maybe it\u2019s your own music but he talks about when you\u2019re feeling anxious or you\u2019re feeling down or you\u2019re feeling depressed. What do you turn to?", "That\u2019s a question that someone asked about the pressure you feel on yourself because things like, \u2018I Am A God\u2019, this sense of you being a divine power, does that scare you?", "And having a family gives you more motivation to do that?", "and I would be the closest thing to that. Those were be the sonic paintings. Fashion, clothes are sculptures, wearable art. Now, if you think about any brand, do you love every single thing from a brand?", "Does that make it easier to care less about critics?", "Do you think Barack Obama has done enough?", "I met you at a dinner in Paris with Riccardo Tisci and we had a really great talk and one thing stuck in my mind. You said that you felt that there was a new form of racism called class, and no one was talking about it. I found that really interesting because I come from a radical background, my father was a Marxist and you told me your parents were also radicals. Can you explain to me more what you mean about that and is that something you want to explore further?", "I definitely think I\u2019ve said \u2018Bitch, get out the car\u2019 in some of my lyrics and stuff like that. And is there a responsibility?", "Yeah. And that\u2019s the reason why, with the help of Anna Wintour and other people, we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage. The majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive. And even the negative can\u2019t outshine the truth. The truth shall come to light. You see it in front of you. You read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that, they\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s a possibility that he\u2019s thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than I thought.\u2019 So, let me dig into what I think the gist is of what that person was asking. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids?", "That just comes from you?", "I\u2019d never call out what would be the last. I'd call out what would spark more inspiration. I will think of a philosophy or think of something I want to say. I think hm this would be a great opening line or maybe I want to abstract the way you even hear rap. A lot of people liked the original of \u2018All Day\u2019 better than the one that eventually got released and that was so much more like a freestyle but it left things really open which felt more like later Picasso works. Oh yes, as you guys know, I think I\u2019m Picasso also or the closest thing to it. So lesser, equal or maybe even better. Maybe there\u2019s something that\u2019s more Cubist about the way I rap and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to find where. It\u2019s like do you really need to paint every angel wing in?", "be wife. I talk to my friends. I just talk. I get really explicit, you know, with the way that I feel at that time. I\u2019m extremely open. That way, I can sweat the anxiety out. I open up the pores and sweat the anxiety out or sweat what I\u2019m worried about or say, \u2018What are we doing?", "Do you feel it\u2019s true all creatives die alone due to lack of understanding?", "I don\u2019t have a name for him, but what I hope for him is that he can feel purpose, that he can learn, that he has the opportunities. The other night, I was driving in Paris and I saw these three high school kids running at top speed. I don\u2019t know if they were chasing a guy or what. Once they got up to the street, there was a bus pulling off and they\u2019re beating on the side of the bus. Then I looked at the time and it was 1am so that might be the last bus of the night. And I was really saddened because I was like, \u2018How can I make my son feel that?", "That\u2019s not frustrating. There were some things earlier that were frustrating to me because they were so backhanded and ignorant in their approach, not really embracing... But no one\u2019s being like \u2018Man, I know I saw people lined up for three days for your shoes but one day, will you be respected as a designer?", "When have you felt that?", "Do you feel like if you haven\u2019t dropped out, you would be where you are?", "In a lot of your last interviews, you focus so much more on fashion rather than music. It seems like your album has been delayed because you\u2019re working on your clothing lines. Is fashion your main passion instead of music?", "Does that annoy you?", "I\u2019m not even concerned about bringing something to fashion. I\u2019m just... I just want to be five years old. You know, when I was five years old I picked out my outfit for kindergarten. I would go to discount furrier, my mum would take me to discount furrier and I would keep grabbing furs and say, \u2018What about this one mum?", "Do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family?", "So there\u2019s no chance the album you\u2019re working on will be your last just to stop a bit of that pressure?", "How do you think your portrayal through lyrics, visual, quotes of the black woman formed pop culture\u2019s understanding of black women?", "With your lyrical process, is it important to you that the listener completely understands explicitly what you\u2019re saying, like with each line, or is it better that they just take the abstract emotional gist of the song?", "doubt?", "A lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that\u2019s why people see your work as political or about social issues. Perhaps it\u2019s a compliment. They want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters. It doesn\u2019t seem like you see it like that?", "I think I\u2019m a humanist. Is that a party?"]}, {"song_title": "In Cold Blood", "questions": ["Right?", "Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?", "You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?", "how many times I gotta warn you?"]}, {"song_title": "In Cold Blood (Remix)", "questions": ["why ask why?", "You heard me?", "See?", "what?", "I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?"]}, {"song_title": "In Common (Remix)", "questions": ["You cool?", "You up?", "You talk?", "Who wants to love somebody like me?", "Who are you?", "Hello, you there?", "You wanna love somebody like me?", "What you mean, you been bad?", "So are we done or we finished?"]}, {"song_title": "I Need To Know", "questions": ["I need to know, you down to do whatever?", "Down to get it poppin'?", "Who ready to fuck?", "And would I do 'em again?"]}, {"song_title": "In For The Kill (Remix)", "questions": ["And what are feelings without emotions?"]}, {"song_title": "Instagram Posts", "questions": []}, {"song_title": "Interview Magazine: Cover Story Excerpt", "questions": ["I grew up in Europe, in London, and you grew up in the States.

Kim be playing, what's the song, \"I know you care\", what's that song?", "Why, why'd he say that?", "Is it in the music with this album, maybe?", "What happens when she gets older, though?", "How was that first conversation?", "and Kim have a problem?", "The only thing I was saying last time was those fashion people don't love you, so it's like, why ask them for help?", "But they're beautiful, you know how many people wanna be that beautiful?", "She don't get insulted when you say that?", "21..20?", "girlfriend and saying, \"Listen, calm it down, leave my wife alone and just chill out.\"?", "You've used it in more than that setting. Where did that come from?", "Yeah getting to know. It's all this, \"Oh should we let him sit at the table, should we not let him sit at the table?", "What did she say?", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever one an album of the year Grammy. And this is funny because Taylor was talking to me about this. She was saying that when she was the victim she won every award and now that she's powerful and the biggest selling artist, now she's not winning awards anymore, cause they're like \"what do you need?", "Yeah those were just fashion people that you were getting to know?", "Cause, I could do, I can like bend my voice in other ways, like at the end of Runaway and everything?", "Dame Dash at the BET Awards, BET Honors. Why'd you let him present you with that award?", "and it brought my wife to tears. Anybody I play it for. And people ask me why did I go \"Only One\" over \"All Day.\" \"Only One\" made me feel like me. It made me feel like this was the song I had to play back in the studio if Cam'Ron and Jim Jones and whoever played 30 Dipset records, what am I gonna play to be the pink Polo?", "They're closer in age than a lot of relationships that I know, you know?", "Is that where the song, \"Wolves\" came from?", "But any relationship that starts off you ain't gonna have all the control. You know what I'm saying?", "Do you and Jay still have a good relationship?", "Ironically or you think they did that on purpose?", "Says who though?", "And why did you do that at the Grammys?", "5000 sweat shirts everybody spending that money trying to show up in the club, and act like they.. You know what I'm saying?", "So you asked Drake to do an album?", "How do we know you're telling us the truth and you're not just being politically correct cause of your corporate connects?", "350?", "Last year when it was so much racial tension and you know the police brutality and stuff, like it's almost like people wanted you to say something. Were you purposely falling back from being vocal about the Mike Brown situation and things like that?", "I wish. I would have gladly, happily have liked to. Cause by the way it's very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that's with Amber Rose so she wasn't sending nothing, you know what I'm saying?", "How much of this album is done?", "Bars. Songs. You know, cook out music that just feels good, you know, like my last album was a protest to music. I was like, \"I'ma take my ball and go home.\" If y'all ain't gonna let me play the way I wanna play or do clothes or do this, start shootin' the ball real slow, might be at the free throw for a long time just... That was my whole album. The album don't even got no music. I just let y'all have a little music on there on \"Bound\" but that was it. But this album's just embracing the music, embracing joy, and being of service to the people. I just hope that people like it and enjoy it, you know?", "I mean people joke that they look sorta like the Uggs, right?", "Are you like, okay, obviously she's gonna be spoiled because we're her parents, but does it concern you that you wanna make sure she's got some type of street sense or anything like that?", "law is inappropriate?", "When did the hood wanna know that?", "Now one thing the hood all wants to know, where did that soft whisper Michael Jackson voice come from?", "Do you hold grudges or are you cool to work with people even after that?", "Did you ask Drake?", "Yeah, my friends, we call them her uncles. Her uncles definitely gonna put her on and definitely. It's this toy, I wish I knew, what's the name of the brand of the toy, Gabe?", "She's just soaking in the moment, nobody feel compelled to do nothing. If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, it wouldn't be an Amber Rose. You know what I'm saying?", "So you did name your daughter after N.O.R.E.?", "Suprise?", "Did you tell Dame that?", "Why?", "?", "Yeah, yeah, I mean think about it, no one can tell me where to have my child or not, you know?", "Man don't, nobody wants, the worst thing... the thing that America doesn't want... America and the world, they antagonize black men. Black men aren't intimate in their own country and they're not in power and all this so you constantly get poked at. But the thing that they hate the most is the angry black man, even though they can cause you to be angry. They hate that, and you know, if you could just understand how to not get angry, in a boxing match, you know if you get angry, you lost. This is a match of life, a match of culture, and if I'm angry all the time I've already lost. So I just need to stop being angry. And people say, yeah what does he have to be angry about?", "That's why we need to support the people that support us, and not just particularly a black thing. We always say this is a black show, you know it's gonna be a while. I ain't got the answers on how to change the voting system, I ain't got the answers on how to make it everyone is honoured in the proper way, and sometimes maybe there's two people that should win. Who's to say who should win?", "You mentioned Minister Farrakhan, I also saw you say when you was backstage at the Grammy's you said you didn't want to speak to much cause you didn't want to jeopardize your clothing line, but a lot of people don't like to stand next to the Minister cause they feel like he jeopardizes their business. Why are you not afraid to show your relation with the Minister?", "Listen, I saw you say, I was watching something on TV and they said you were saying that fashion lines didn't want to deal with you cause you were married to a reality show star. Just on a business level, cause personally we can tell you're happy, just on a business level do you feel the Kardashian brand has hurt Kanye West's brand?", "Oh about bringing North West to the fashion show. That was alleged though, they said allegedly she said that's not the proper place for a child. You know?", "Is that why you kept the lights low at the Grammys?", "at what point will you say, \"I am a designer.\" Do you feel like there is gonna be a point or you're just a creator?", "And Beanie came through with the pistol and held you down?", "Kim's not the only picture on the wall, right?", "I felt like it was only right. You came here, you know what I'm saying?", "But you know, he should win an award for what he did. You know, rock album or something like that. But he shouldn\u2019t have won that award in my opinion. But who am I to have an opinon. Ya know?", "Do you feel like you may owe Beanie something for that?", "I know it\u2019s really ironic that it\u2019s always Beyonce for some reason. Why is It Beyonce?", "Yeah something like that but you know, he was right. You know what I'm saying?", "Your album, what kind of album are we getting?", "Working with Paul McCartney, I read an article where they compare you to John Lennon. Has Paul McCartney ever said anything to you about that?", ", you stand up for her maybe more than you stand up for your own wife. Recently, people been going at your wife crazy, from the Paper magazine cover, they say, \"Why would she do that?", "But they don't have anything else?", "Teyana Taylor, what's going on with her?", "Did E give backlash, like, \"Kris control your son\" or something like that?", "The MILF lane, is that what you're tryna say?", "So you hadn't even heard the Beck album when you did the rant?", "What?", "When did I do that?", "You know what?", "Yeah the Minister's very sharp. You think it's kind of confusing when he'll say negative things about Jewish people but then say we should learn from them?", "hop reparations?", "60. I mean, we about to flip this whole thing on its head, it's a new idea of apparel. And they've got information, and I had to ask them, I had to be humble, I had to beg to go to dinners, and I had to explain to them, \"why should we work with you, Ye, how we know you're not just another celebrity that's gonna wear a red leather jacket and you're gonna diss us in public?", "I have no idea they just priced it that. I think they just, I think their logic was they didn't want it to go from um, the other company and go to Adidas and be like man, why they drop the price?", "Now recently you said when you first got with Kim you lost a lot of friends. Why was that and who?", "So is it true that one time you were in a restaurant and when you had the pink, back in the pink Polo days, some dudes in New York were gon' rob you?", "Did you reach out to Beck after though?", "Obviously they connect to some business sense because they're all successful, family and all multimillionaires. One thing I think about with me is look how long it's taking me to turn any of my friends to a multimillionaire. Kim did it like that. She did it out the gate, she was like, \" We gon' take Khloe, we gon' take Kourtney, we gon' take Kourtney's boyfriend, we gon' take the kids, we gon' take this and we all gon' be millionaires like that.\" Reality is like rap.
